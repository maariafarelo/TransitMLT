### This is our project for LauzHack 2023!

Switzerland’s diverse landscape calls for a mobility solution that is as flexible and varied as the needs of its people. Our vision is clear: create a sustainable and interconnected transportation system 
 that serves everyone, from city dwellers to countryside residents. This challenge invited us to develop a comprehensive travel planner that integrates personal vehicle use with SBB’s Park and Rail options and public transport networks. Our solution tries to offer efficient, user-friendly routing choices that cater to different preferences, whether for example it’s reducing the number of transfers, optimizing for speed, or minimizing environmental impact or other criteria. The aim is to provide a practical, adaptable tool that enhances mobility for all, making it easier for individuals to navigate the unique Swiss geography in an eco-conscious manner. Our innovation could not only improve daily commutes but also contribute to a broader vision of sustainable and accessible transportation in Switzerland.
